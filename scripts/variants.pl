## This script will deal with histone variants. They are not really the subject
## of this paper but a table listing all of the variant histones is useful and
## easy. It will generate the following files:
##
##    * variables-variants.tex
##
## Usage is:
##
## variants.pl --sequences path/for/sequences --results path/for/results

## Check input options
my %path = MyLib::parse_argv("sequences", "results");

my @variants = MyLib::load_variant ($path{sequences});

my $var_path = File::Spec->catdir($path{results}, "variables-variants.tex");

  or die "Could not open $var_path for writing: $!";

say {$var_file} HistoneCatalogue::latex_newcommand (

  "Total number of histone variants genes"
);
