## This script will deal with histone variants. They are not really the subject
## of this paper but a table listing all of the variant histones is useful and
## easy. It will generate the following files:
##
##    * table-variant_catalogue.tex (a very long LaTeX table with all variant
##      histones, their UIDs, and transcript and protein accession numbers)
##    * variables-variants.tex
##
## Usage is:
##
## variants.pl --sequences path/for/sequences --results path/for/results

## Check input options
my %path = MyLib::parse_argv("sequences", "results");

## Get the variant genes and order them by gene symbol
my @variants = sort {$$a{histone} cmp $$b{histone} || $$a{symbol} cmp $$b{symbol}}
  MyLib::load_variant ($path{sequences});
