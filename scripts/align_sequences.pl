## This script will get the downloaded sequences from all canonical histones, align
## them, and create a LaTeX table with
## the differences between each histone.
##
## It will create the following files:
##    * results/aligned_H2A_proteins.fasta (one for each histone)
##    * results/aligned_H2A_cds.fasta (one for each histone)
##    * results/table-H2A-proteins-align.tex (one per histone, with the differences
##      between the different histone proteins in tabular form)
##    * results/variables-align_results.tex (LaTeX variables for the numbers
##      of unique histone proteins)
##
## Usage is:
##
## align_sequences --sequences path/for/sequences --results path/for/results --figures path/for/figures
##
## where:
##    * path/for/sequences - directory used by bp_genbank_ref_extractor to save sequences
##    * path/for/results   - directory where this script will save the LaTeX tables and aligned sequences
##    * path/for/figures   - directory where this script will save the seqlogo eps files
##
## If we are using this script, we will be using TCoffee http://www.tcoffee.org/

## Flow of this script:
##    1 - read in all protein sequences of all canonical histone, creating a Bio::Seq
##        object for each of them
##    2 - multiple sequence alignment for each
##    3 - compare each protein to the most common sequence, listing each difference
##    4 - make pretty LaTeX table to display it
