## SYNOPSIS
##
##   align_transcripts.pl path/dbfile path/input/protein/alignment path/output/transcript/alignment
##
## DESCRIPTION
##
## To align histone transcript sequences, we actually want it to
## perform the alignment in multiples of 3.  So we use the protein
## alignment, and simply map it back to its CDS sequences.

## Takes an alignment file and calls weblogo on it.  It sets our settings
## for histone proteins and then modifies it for our prefereed visualization
## where only the changes are in black.

## accessions to the corresponding transcript Bio::Seq objects.

## aa_to_dna_aln() only changes the actual sequences.  It does not change
## anything else such as display_id and description which are used again
## to write the.file.  But when we write the transcript alignment, we want
## to have the right accession numbers for the transcripts.  Fix that:
