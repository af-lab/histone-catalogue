  \begin{abstract}
    Core histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 are encoded
    by a large family of genes distributed across the human genome.
    Canonical core histones contribute the majority of proteins to bulk chromatin packaging,
    and are encoded by \TotalCodingGenes{} human genes comprising
    \HTwoACodingGenes{} for H2A,
    \HTwoBCodingGenes{} for H2B,
    \HThreeCodingGenes{} for H3 
    and \HFourCodingGenes{} for H4,
    along with at least \TotalPseudoGenes{} total pseudogenes.
    The canonical histone genes display coding variation that gives rise to
    \HTwoAUniqueProteins{} H2A, \HTwoBUniqueProteins{} H2B,
    \HThreeUniqueProteins{} H3 and \HFourUniqueProteins{} unique H4 protein isoforms.
    This represents a surprising and seldom recognised variation
    diverging to as far as \todo{lowest identity}\% amino acid identity.
    The gene sequence and protein isoform diversity
    exceeds commonly used subtype designations such as H2A.1 and H3.1
    and exists in parallel to the well-known specialisation of variant histones.
    To assist understanding of the implications of histone diversity
    we have curated and catalogued the entire human canonical core histone gene and protein complement.
    This work has led to multiple corrections to human histone annotations,
    reflecting the flux of the human genome as it is updated and enriched in reference databases.
    To avoid obsolescence and maximise accessibility of this information,
    we have developed a novel software framework that dynamically generates the canonical histone repertoire
    based on current genome annotations and inserts the information into manuscript format.
    This approach is inspired by the aims of reproducible research
    and can readily be adapted to histones of other organisms and to other gene families.
