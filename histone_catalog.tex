  \section{Introduction}
    %% Complementary introduction on the chromatin organization and how it's dynamic

    %% short 2-3 lines on chromatin organization and dynamics}
    Histones are among the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells and contribute up to half
    the mass of chromatin. They define the structure and accessibility of the nucleosome as the
    fundamental unit of genome organisation. In addition, the reactive sidechains\think{what about H3 T45?} of histones
    are post-translationally modified as a nexus for signalling and potentially for heritable
    epigenetics.

    Histones have been studied for many decades as abundant proteins which were readily isolated
    due to their highly basic chemical character. Successive improvements in fractionation revealed
    5 main types currently known as histone H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4\cite{Histonenomenc}. An additional histone type, H5
    related to H1, is found in nucleus-containing avian erythrocytes and has been of research interest
    due to its elevated binding stability. Since the ratio of arginine/lysine is \HOneArgLysRatio\ for H1 and H5 these
    became known as ``lysine-rich'', whereas the remaining 4 histones with ratios \OthersArgLysRatio\ \think{should repeated proteins count twice?}are ``arginine-rich''.
    The demonstration of the nucleosome as the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin revealed that H2A,
    H2B, H3 and H4 associated as an octamer of two copies each within the nucleosome core particle,
    so they are referred to as ``core histones''. H1 and H5 associate with the linker DNA between
    nucleosome core particles, and are referred to as ``linker histones''.

    \subsection{Histone variation\think{call this section 'histone variants?' would be stronger and hints at the message we want to pass but may sound arrogant}}
      %% Explain that despite the fact that there's 4 core histones, there's actually several isoforms of each
      %% Say that no one bothers to explain which one they are using
      %% Comment that maybe the lack of information is because they are so similiar which makes difficult most of the analysis
      %% We are going to annotate all canonical histone genes on (at least GenBank and Ensembl)
      %% Complain that there's small reason to call some the .1 variant, and the others .2

      For each histone type, there are two recognised classes of histone sequence variation which are distinguished
      by their expression regulation: \think{expression regulation sounds bad} ``variants'', and ``canonical isoforms'' (Table~\ref{tab:typical-histone-differences}).
      However, the variation level among the canonical isoforms, the main subject of this report\think{should I call it paper or article?},
      is frequently underestimated and usually ignored. For sake of brevity, we will
      refer to the core canonical histones as simply ``histones''.

%      Despite the small differences between these canonical histone isoforms,
%      canonical histones are sometimes known as ``wild type'' sequences and are usually considered together
%      as a single histone.
%      The widespread awareness of high conservation in histone protein sequences means that the true extent
%      of protein and gene sequence variation in canonical histones is often under-appreciated. Albig and

        \caption{Typical vision of differences between canonical and variant histones.}
        \label{tab:typical-histone-differences}
      \end{table}

      Histone ``variants'' play functionally distinctive roles, have lower net abundance, and typically show less
      identity in alignments. Most are significantly expressed outside S~phase of the cell cycle and as such, are
      referred to as ``replication independent''~(RI). They typically have unique promoter elements\addref and their
      transcripts carry 3' polyadenylated tails.

      In contrast, ``canonical isoforms'' histones contribute to the primary function and majority of nucleosome
      structures, and show high identity in alignments. Because they are primarily
      expressed to package the duplicated genome during S~phase, showing a 35~fold increase on expression
      during this phase \cite{harris-1991}, they are referred to as ``replication dependent''~(RD) or ``replacement''
      histones. They appear to share a common promoter structure (Fig.~\ref{fig:promoter-alignment}) and
      a unique stem-loop structure in the 3' untranslated region that is the
      basis for their turnover.

      Extracting histones from cells and separating them by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using
      the strongly anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and neutral buffers gives single bands
      for each histone type\think{even for the very different H2AZ and CENP--A?}. If instead, it is done in acetic acid in gels containing the non-ionic detergent
      Triton X--100 and uncharged urea as denaturants (TAU or AUT), the histones are separated
      into multiple species due to both post-translational modifications and variations in sequence
      within types. However, not all variations in sequence create a large enough effect on protein charge
      to allow TAU separation which lead to the distinction between H2A.1 and H2A.2; H2B.1 and H2B.2;
      and H3.1, H3.2 and H3.3\cite{Non-allelicva}. This distinction is purely chemical, has no known
      functional significance, and camouflages the actual variation within each histone type.

    \subsection{Current situation\think{this name sucks}}
      \cite{Marzluff02} is the existing reference for histone variation and nomenclature. However, it contains
      some oversights~(Table~\ref{tab:difference-from-Marzluff02}), most likeley due to the ``draft'' status of the genome it was based on.
      Similarly, the annotation of RefSeq and SwissProt \think{swissprot is not the ensembl equivalent to genbank's RefSeq. Is it Havana? But HAVANA only annoates the genome. And RefSeq is the project not the sequences, it's the sequences who needs annotation}
      is not yet complete, the histone genes containing some omissions and inconsistencies for the untranslated regions,
      transcripts and classification of genes between protein coding and pseudo genes.

      We have extracted the current sequences for all histone genes from RefSeq, finished \think{it's really never finished}
      their annotation and submitted them back to RefSeq. With this, we hope to have created a useful
      reference for other researchers while raising awareness of the multitude of histone isoforms.

      Due to the computational nature of this project, we have developed a method that would generate the tables and
      figures for this report automatically (Sec.~\ref{sec:reproducible}). This implied choosing a reference which
      was RefSeq from NCBI. As such, tables and figures on this paper are representative of RefSeq's current annotation and
      different results would be obtained had HAVANA been used. Likewise, the RefSeq maintainers did not always
      agreed with our suggested changes, and we have expressed those differences in the main text or figure and
      table captions.

  \section{The genes}
   %%there's several isoforms for histones and no one bothers about them
%    Fitting to their important task, histone genes and proteins show some unusual characteristics.
%    One of the most blatant of them but still mostly ignored, is the existence of several unique protein
%    sequences \think{should explain better that we're not talking about SNP?} that despite having
%    officially different names, are grouped together and rarely identified. These histone
%    \emph{isoforms} are different from the so-called histone \emph{variants} whose distinction
%    is based on their 3' UTR processing and genome positioning.

    \subsection{Gene clusters}
      The genes encoding canonical histone isoforms are typically found in clusters in most eukaryotic genomes,
      possibly for regulatory and expression functions and to facilitate sequence conservation. These clusters
      are observed to aggregate within the nucleoplasm with processing factors as Histone Locus Bodies
      (HLBs) similar but distinct from Cajal bodies\addref. In human, there are 4 histone gene clusters which
      are numbered by their size (Table~\ref{tab:histone-gene-count}).

      \subsubsection{Internal cluster organization}
        The major and secondary histone gene clusters,
        HIST1 on chromosome 6, and HIST2 on chromosome 1, contain contiguous high density arrays
        of histone genes. HIST1 encodes \CodingGenesInHistOne{}~functional genes and \PseudoGenesInHistOne{}~pseudogenes
        over a span of \HistOneSpan{} and is the second most gene dense region on the megabase scale the genome \addref[Xie 2003].
        It is located at the distal end of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in the extended class I region at chromosome
        6p21-22 \addref[MHC consortium Nature 1999] which may have an effect on its recombination. HIST2 encodes \CodingGenesInHistTwo{}~functional
        genes and \PseudoGenesInHistTwo{}~pseudogenes over a span of \HistTwoSpan{}.
        %%HIST1 spans HIST1H2AA-HIST1H2BO 25726291-27861669; HIST2 spans HIST2H2BF-HIST2H2AB 149754245-149859466 (ensembl genome browser)

        On the other hand, the minor clusters, HIST3 also on chromosome 1, and HIST4 on chromosome 12, have only a
        handful of histone genes, \CodingGenesInHistThree{} and \CodingGenesInHistFour{} respectively, interspersed with
        non-histone coding genes.

        \rewrite{Talk about gene density of clusters, GC content, patterns of divergent promoters?}

        In humans, these genes are all jumbled in the clusters unlike
        frogs where the genes appear organized in tandem. Not all genes in the cluster are functional, several have
        been annotated has pseudo-genes, ususally due to not found promotor sequences.

        To note that all H1 genes exist on HIST1 and that HIST4 has a single gene (HIST4H4) which has been reported to be transcripted.

        \subsubsection{Proximity of stability and variation}
        %% Talk about how hyperrecombinational MHC next to HIST1, and deletion-duplication prone 1q21.1 adjacent to HIST2 (Brunetti-Pierri 2008)

    \subsection{Gene nomenclature}

      Histone genes have a very specific nomenclature that reflects their organization in the genome.

      \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{nomenclature-schematic.pdf}
        \caption{Nomenclature}
        \label{fig:nomenclature}
      \end{figure}

      A typical replication histone gene has a name such as HIST1H3B. This name can be split in
      3 parts (Fig.~\ref{fig:nomenclature}): HIST1, H3, and B. The first two parts are self-explanatory,
      an H3 gene on the histone cluster 1. The last letter indicates that is the second H3 gene on the cluster.
      The first gene of the cluster, and by association the start of the cluster, is the gene closest to the telomere
      while the last gene of the cluster, marking the end of the cluster, is the one closer to the centromere. When
      there was only one gene of the histone in a cluster, there was no letter indicating its position. However, there is
      one omission from the list, the gene HIST1H2AE is followed by HIST1H2AG, skipping the letter F. This is due
      to another characteristic of the nomenclature, the names also represent the mouse orthologs which makes it easier
      to cross data between the two animal models. There is a Hist1h2af (capitalization
      of the gene name is different between human and mouse) gene in mouse that simply has no correspondent in human.

      This nomenclature was originally described in \cite{Marzluff02} and made no distinction between pseudo and protein coding genes; suspected
      pseudo genes were still named based on their position inside the cluster. ``New'' histone genes have since been found in the clusters,\think{some of them are just inferred}
      most of them pseudo genes, and others had their type changed from coding to pseudo and vice-versa (Table~\ref{tab:difference-from-Marzluff02}).
      This forced some genes to be renamed: HIST2H2AA is now named HIST2H2AA3 (a new H2A coding gene HIST2H2AA4 was found between HIST1H2AA and HIST1H2AB);
      and HIST2H2B is now named HIST2H2BA (after the discovery of another H2B coding gene in the cluster named HIST2H2BB).\think{it seems their names are not correspondent to the order in cluster}
      Other new coding genes were discovered at the end of the cluster and as such their names could respect the nomenclature. However,
      several new pseudo genes were discovered in the middle of the cluster. These were named differently, with the suffix PS#
      and numbered by order of discovery. Genes reported at the time of the nomenclature but had their gene type changed to pseudo
      kept their original names.

        \caption{Difference from \cite{Marzluff02}}
        \label{tab:difference-from-Marzluff02}
      \end{table}

      The names for the variants are much more different. With the exception of CENP--A (H3 variant named CENtromeric Protein A),
      all histone variants are named in a similar fashion to H2AFX. The histone type, followed by the letter F (which stands for
      Family). The last characters identify the variant and usually have an historical or functional meaning. For example, H2AFX
      and H2AFZ are named accordingly to their migration order in acetic acid-urea gels.

    \subsection{Gene promoters}

  \section{The transcripts}

    In general, metazoan canonical histones
    are not thought to be polyadenylated, although \textit{S.\ cerevisiae} histone transcript stability
    appears to be regulated by polyadenylation instead of RNA structures.

    \subsection{mRNA expression levels}
      %% levels of mRNA of each histone gene in 2-3 different human cell lines (at least one primary cell line)
      Expression of the RD histone genes is highly regulated by the cell cycle (hence the RD name). Probably due
      to the cell high demand for histone proteins during DNA replication, their expression levels rise dramatically
      during this phase of the cell cycle. During the rest of the cell cycle, histone genes are still transcribed
      but with much lower levels.

      However, there is only a 5-fold increase in their transcription rate at S phase, compared to the other phases
      of cell cycle so regulation acts strongly at the post-transcriptional level\addref.

      To note however, that each gene seems to have different levels of increased transcription, even between genes in the
      same cluster.

      RI histone genes have expression dependent on their needs (testis specific, DNA damage, etc).

    \subsection{Stem-loop}
      Unlike all the other human genes, RD histone genes lack a poly-A tail for the 3' mRNA processing.
      Instead, they encode a stem-loop followed by a purine-rich Histone Downstream Element (HDE)
      downstream of the stop codon. The stem-loop interacts with the Stem-Loop
      Binding Protein (SLBP) to stabilise the mRNA in S phase \addref
      while the HDE interacts with U7 snRNA to direct efficient 3 end processing\addref.

      This specific machinery for mRNA processing is a large part of increase on transcription during the S--phase
      since their expression is also regulated by the cell-cycle \adderf and allow for the histone mRNA stability \addref.

      Some RD histone genes also have annotated a poly-A tail and in similarlity with H2AFX have two annotated transcripts.
      
      However, RI histone genes do show a poly-A tail with the notable pseudo-exception of H2AFX which has both
      a stem-loop and poly-A tail and transcribes 2 different mRNA (one for each).
  %        \missingfigure{consensus of human stem-loop.}

      No RI histone genes show introns on their genes probably to circumvent the requirement
      for primary transcript processing when histones must be rapidly produced at S--phase.
      However, some of the variants do have introns.

  \section{The proteins}
    %% Consensus for each of them, table with their differences (there's at least 1 error on the Marzulff tables)
    %% table with all gene ids, acession number, official symbols etc
    While some of the histone genes encode the same protein, this is not always the case. On the case of H4 and H3 \think{are H3 and H4
    maybe more important for the nucleosome structure} the number of unique proteins are low, 3 for H3 and 2 for H4. For H2A and H2B
    this number is much higher.\think{should I get a table for the number of unique proteins? The more complex table with the mutatinos
    is more complex but says the same}

    The numbering of these proteins amino acids also has a catch. The first methionine is cleaved after expression and as such, it is
    never counter when numbering them.

  \section{Canonical isoforms vs.~variants}
    %% Characteristics of a variant are the fact they seem to have special functions. Emphasis that some canonical may have special functions whicyh no one bothered to check
    %% variants with extra special nomenclature are outside the histone clusters and have poly-A tails (sometimes)
    %% Complain about the lack of information on the different isoforms
    \rewrite{
      Rules and exceptions to definition of canonical and variants. Also point that the word canonical suggest antecedence which is not necessarily true (ref to our paper and Henikoff's)
    }

    Variants are the most likely with a standard gene, are considered independent from each other,
    spread around the genome and its expression is mostly independent of cell cycle \think{explain
    why mostly? Do it next paragraph when complaining the naming}. When people say H2AX that's
    a variant. Note, H2A.2 and H3.2 are not considered variants.

    Both this separation and their naming is very misleading\think{say that the fact that no one cares is proof?}
    for several reasons.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The word canonical suggests precedence which is not necessarily true. It has been
            suggested that at least in the case of H2A, the `canonical' gene may have evolved
            from one of the `variant' genes\addref.
      \item Not all `variant' are replication-independent. H2AX gene for example expression
            increases during S--phase together with other `canonical' histones and does show
            a transcript with stem-loop.
      \item The `variant' vs `canonical' separation suggests that there's no variance inside
            the `canonical' which is false. There's several unique protein sequences for each
            `canonical' protein. And even the sometime named H2A.2 and H3.2 variants are actually
            `canonical' histone proteins.
    \end{itemize}

  \section{Sequence extractor}
    To obtain the sequences for the alignment, curation, and IDs for the tables, a perl program using the
    BioPerl modules was written. This program performs a search for genes on entrez, retrieves
    their sequences from the reference assembly, mRNAs and proteins. The sequences are saved in separate files whose
    names are either the gene/transcript/protein name or id.

    The program (bp\_sequence\_extractor) was submitted to the BioPerl project to be distributed together with it under the GPLv3.

  \section{Reproducible research}
  \label{sec:reproducible}
    While writing this document, we attempted to follow the principles of reproducible research \cite{reproducible-research-bioinformatics, reproducible-research-law}.
    We are also aware of the continuous development of databases and genetic knowledge. As such,
    the source code to replicate the tables and figures shown in this document are freely accessible
    online at gitorious. We hope that in the future, it can be used to create up to date information
    that reflects the current knowledge on the human histone genes.

    The choice of RefSeq through Entrez over HAVANA through Ensembl was mainly based in one reason --- the ease
    to automate the gene search and retrieve their IDs. Entrez has made available E-utilities with a SOAP interface
    that is already part of the bioperl project. This allowed us to retrieve the search results very easily.
    However, the Ensembl search is done by a Lucene server which is not publicly accessible. Setting up our own
    Lucene instance to provide SOAP services from it was not straightforward for us. The Ensembl perl API is
    also not part of the bioperl project, needing to be installed separately, and is dependent on a very
    out of date version of Bioperl, further complicating its installation. All this would make reproducibility
    of our data a much more difficult process by other researchers.
