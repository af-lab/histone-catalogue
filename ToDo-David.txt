Programmatic Tasks To Do

1a. Output table of IDs frrom histone-catalogue as files:
- tab-delimited text (ie parseable and human readable)

1b. Output all sequences in fasta for:
- coding regions of genes (used for CUSP)
- aligned coding regions (used for SNAP)
- proteins (used for logos)
- stem-loops and HDEs(used for stem-loop-seqlogo and HDE-seqlogo)

2. Table of codon usage
http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/release/6.3/emboss/apps/cusp.html
For each canonincal histone type
- Extract all coding regions
- Parse output for fraction
- Insert into table histone-gene-codonusage (supplementary.tex) and (genes.tex)

3. Table of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions
http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/SNAP/perlsnap.html
For each canonincal histone type
- Align (note that aligner needs to be weighted to only do 3 base multiples for insertions)
- Trim to coding region
- Apply SNAP
- Parse output to:
  - Calculate average of Sd column
  - Calculate average of Sn column
  - Calculate average of ds/dn column (or extract value at bottom)
- Insert into table histone-gene-differences (supplementary.tex) and Sn values into genes.tex

4. Write an index of all variables and formatted constructs avaialble for insertion.

Format and Structure fixes

1. Percentage calculation in paragraph 1 of genes.tex

2. Problems with bibtext for later entries in references.bib being assigned as "?". Is there a typo in a field?
