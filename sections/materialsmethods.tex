\section{Materials and methods}
\label{sec:matmethods}

  The primary manuscript is generated from a \LaTeX{} source
  deriving dynamic data from automatic builds using SCons \citep{SCons2005}.
  Core processing is performed by bp\_genbank\_ref\_extractor
  which is available in the Bio-EUtilities module, part of the
  BioPerl project \citep{bioperl}.

  All sources are freely available in a github repository
  \url{https://github.com/af-lab/histone-catalogue}, including all
  sources for figures, manuscript templates and build system making public
  all parameters used for processing.

  Processing for this mansucript version generated on \todo{Insert manuscript timestamp}
  used BioPerl \BioPerlVersion{} and Bio-EUtilities \BioEUtilitiesVersion{}.
  Sequence and annotation data was obtained from NCBI RefSeq \citep{PruittRefseq2014}
  on \printdate{\SequencesDate{}}.
  Alignments were generated by T-Coffee \TCoffeVersion{} \citep{tcoffee2000}.
  Sequence logos were generated using WebLogo version \todo{weblogo version} \citep{weblogo}.
  Sequences are represented following HGVS recommended nomenclature \citep{mutnomenclature2003}.
