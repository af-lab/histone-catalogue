\section{Materials and methods}

  The primary manuscript is generated from \LaTeX{} sources, derived
  from dynamic data, and built using SCons \citep{SCons2005}. To
  search the Entrez Gene database and download the associated genomic,
  transcript, and protein sequences, we have created the
  bp\_genbank\_ref\_extractor program. This program has been included
  in the Bio-EUtilities distribution since version 1.73. Analysis of
  the data relies heavily on BioPerl \citep{bioperl}.

  All sources are freely available in a git repository at
  \url{https://github.com/af-lab/histone-catalogue.git}, including all
  sources for figures, manuscript templates, and build system making public
  all parameters used for processing.

  This build of the manuscript was generated using BioPerl~\BioPerlVersion{}
  and Bio-EUtilities~\BioEUtilitiesVersion{}.
  Sequence and annotation data was obtained from NCBI RefSeq \citep{OLearyRefseq2016}
  on \printdate{\SequencesDate{}}.
  Sequence alignments were generated by T-Coffee \TCoffeVersion{} \citep{tcoffee2000}.
  Sequence logos were generated using WebLogo version \WebLogoVersion{} \citep{weblogo}.
  Description of sequence variants are represented following HGVS
  recommended nomenclature \citep{mutnomenclature2016}.
