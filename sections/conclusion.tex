\section{Conclusion}

  Comprehensive curation of the canonical core histone gene family
  reveals significant diversity of isoforms,
  and challenges assumptions of bulk chromatin homogeneity.
  It has led to improvements in consistency of genome annotations
  and provides a reference for interpreting genomic and proteomic datasets.
  The differences between canonical core histone protein isoforms
  uncovers novel questions about their functional significance
  that suggest future experimental investigations.
  As a dynamic manuscript this catalogue provides a continuously up-to-date overview
  of the human canonical core histone gene family.
