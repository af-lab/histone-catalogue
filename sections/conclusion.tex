\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

	Comprehensive curation of the canonical core histone gene family 
	has revealed the significant diversity of isoforms 
	that challenges assumptions of ``wild type'' chromatin homogeneity
	responsible for bulk human genome packaging.
	It provides a reference for interpreting genomic and proteomic datasets
	and uncovers a number of canonical histones that are targets for future investigation.
	An overview of histone terms and an explicit statement of nomenclature 
	are included to encourage clarity in usage of terminology.
	As a dynamic manuscript this catalogue provides a continuously up-to-date overview 
	of the canonical core histone gene family.
