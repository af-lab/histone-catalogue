\section{Conclusion}

	Comprehensive curation of the canonical core histone gene family 
	demonstrates isoform diversity that challenges assumptions of chromatin homogeneity.
	Furthermore, it uncovers members with unusual properties 
	including \textit{HIST1H2AA}, \textit{HIST1H2BA} and \textit{HIST1H4G}
	that are targets for future investigation.
	It also clarifies potentially misleading features such as subtype nomenclature 
	based on artitrary TAU PAGE separations depending on specific residues 
	that receive disporoprtionate attention.

	Unfortunately there is considerable confusion in usage of histone terminology,
	and many nomenclature guidelines include inconsistencies and exceptions.
	An overview of histone terms and an explicit statement of nomenclature 
	are included to encourage clarity.

	As a dynamic manuscript this canonical core histone catalogue 
	provides a continuously updated overview of the proteins 
	responsible for human genome packaging.
