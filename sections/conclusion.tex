\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

	Comprehensive curation of the canonical core histone gene family 
	reveals the significant diversity of isoforms 
	and challenges assumptions of ``wild type'' chromatin homogeneity.
	It provides a reference for interpreting genomic and proteomic datasets
	and uncovers a number of canonical histones that are targets for future investigation.

	An overview of histone terms and an explicit statement of nomenclature 
	are included to encourage clarity in usage of terminology.

	As a dynamic manuscript this catalogue provides a continuously updated overview 
	of the canonical core histone gene family responsible for bulk human genome packaging.
