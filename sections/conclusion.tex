\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

  Comprehensive curation of the canonical core histone gene family
  reveals significant diversity of isoforms
  and challenges assumptions of bulk chromatin homogeneity.
  It provides a reference for interpreting genomic and proteomic datasets
  and uncovers a number of canonical histones that are targets for future investigation.
  An overview of histone terms and nomenclature
  are included to facilitate clarity in usage of terminology.
  As a dynamic manuscript this catalogue provides a continuously up-to-date overview
  of the human canonical core histone gene family.
