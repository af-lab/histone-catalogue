\section{Introduction}

  Histones are among the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells 
  and contribute up to half the mass of chromatin. 
  The core histone types H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 
  define the structure and accessibility of the nucleosome 
  as the fundamental repeating unit of genome organisation 
  around which the DNA is wrapped \citep{Luger1997structure}.
  In addition, the many chemically reactive sidechains of histones 
  are post-translationally modified 
  as a nexus for signalling and heritable epigenetics.
  Canonical histones provide the bulk structure and generic function of chromatin
  and are encoded by \TotalGenes{} genes in 4 clusters in the human genome (\tref{tab:histone-gene-count}).

  Relationships within the histone family have been described using a variety of terminologies
  reflecting biochemical, functional and genomic distinctions summarised below (\tref{tab:histone-divisions}).
  
  From a biochemical perspective, histones are abundant proteins 
  that are readily isolated due to their highly basic chemical character. 
  Successive improvements in fractionation ultimately revealed 5 main histone types 
  with nomenclature H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 \citep{nomenclature}.
  An additional H1--related histone H5 is recognised in avian erythrocytes \citep{HFive-review}.

  The demonstration of the nucleosome as the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin \citep{Kornberg1974} 
  revealed that H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 associate as an octamer of two copies each within the
  nucleosome core particle. These four histones are referred to as core histones. 
  In contrast, H1 associates with the linker DNA between nucleosome core particles 
  and is referred to as a linker histone. 
  The 5 human somatic H1 isoforms and 6 tissue-specific variants 
  have been described and catalogued in \citep{HarshmanFreitas2013}.

  Arginine and lysine content was used as an early distinction between the histones. 
  The H1 linker histone has a low arginine/lysine ratio of \LinkerArgLysRatio{} and became known as lysine-rich 
  whereas the remaining 4 core histones are arginine-rich 
  with highest ratios of \HTwoAArgLysRatio{} in H2A, \HTwoBArgLysRatio{} in H2B, 
  \HThreeArgLysRatio{} in H3 and \HFourArgLysRatio{} in H4 type isoforms.
  Nevertheless, the core histones have many lysines particularly in their N-terminal tails.

  Extracting histones and separating them by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
  using the strongly anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS PAGE) and neutral buffers 
  gives single bands for each histone type. 
  However, PAGE with non-ionic detergent Triton X--100 and uncharged urea as denaturants
  in acetic acid buffer (TAU or AUT PAGE) allows the separation of histone types into multiple bands 
  due to post-translational modifications and certain primary sequence variations \citep{PAGEND}. 
  These separations are reflected in subtype designations H2A.1, H2A.2, H3.1, H3.2 and H3.3. 

  From a functional perspective, two classes of core histone 
  are delineated within the core histone types (\tref{tab:typical-histone-differences}).
  Canonical core histones contribute to bulk chromatin structure and 
  their expression is significantly elevated during S~phase to provide chromatin packaging 
  for DNA duplicated during replication. This led to their description as ``replication dependent'', 
  even though a supply of canonical histones is required throughout the cell cycle. 
  Human and other metazoan canonical histone genes are distinctive 
  because they lack introns and give rise to non-polyadenylated proten coding transcripts 
  where turnover is independently regulated via a highly conserved 3' stem-loop.
  
  In contrast, variant histones such as H2A.Z, TH2B and H3.3 have 
  less sequence identity and lower abundance (\tref{tab:typical-histone-differences}). 
  They play functionally specific roles and are mostly expressed outside S~phase, 
  so are decribed as replication independent. 
  Since histone variants are interpreted as taking the place of equivalent canonical histone types, 
  the variant histones are also referred to as ``replacement'' histones.
  
  From a genomic perspective the canonical histone genes are found in four clusters, possibly for regulatory efficiency. 
  The multiple gene copies in the clustered arrays are sometimes confusingly referred to as ``allellic'' 
  and the resulting protein isoforms are often referred to as ``wild type'' 
  although both genes and protein products encompass distinctive variation in sequence and relative abundance, 
  and their functional equivalence has not been tested.
  In contrast, almost all variant histones are encoded by single genes dispersed in the genome 
  with typical properties including introns, alternative splicing and polyadenylated transcripts.
  
  Despite the importance of histones for chromatin organisation and extensive interest
  in their role in epigenetics and regulation, the systematic curation and classification of human histone
  gene and protein sequences has not been revisited for some time \citep{Marzluff02}.
  In the last decade the draft human genome has been finalised 
  and rich annotations continue to propagate into reference gene and protein sequence databases (\tref{tab:difference-from-Marzluff02}).

  In this manuscript we provide a comprehensive catalogue
  of canonical histone genes, proteins and pseudogenes. 
  Since curation and annotation are dynamic and evolving, 
  we have implemented athis manuscript so that it
  can self-update based on the most current data from the NCBI RefSeq database 
  to retain its value as a reference source in an accessible format.
  All automatically generated values are displayed with a light grey background.
  This manuscript generation has remained stable in our laboratory for several years
  and represents an example of ``reproducible research'' \citep{Claerbout2000}
  that provides a model for curating gene families.
